# Adafruit SI7021 Temperature and Humidity Sensor Driver for Android Things

I'm tyrying to get my SI7021 sensonr working. So I started by making a Driver and a quick app to get it going.

### What I have achieved so far

I started with the [Android Things weather station sample application](https://github.com/androidthings/weatherstation), then modified it to match my own Driver.
